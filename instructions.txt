Before running the program, please make sure to set up your OpenAI and AlphaGenome API Key:
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
$env:ALPHA_GENOME_API_KEY="your-key"

The following packages also needed to be downloaded:
pip install openai 
pip install alphagenome 

About using AlphaGenome:
NOTE: AlphaGenome works best with GRCh38/hg38. GRCh37/hg19 may give less accurate results.
SEQUENCE LENGTH SELECTION (Option 4):

The sequence length determines how much DNA context around your variant 
AlphaGenome analyzes:

• 2KB (2,000 bases):
  - Fastest analysis
  - Focus on immediate splice sites
  - Good for debugging or quick checks
  - Use when: Testing or rapid screening

• 16KB (16,000 bases):
  - Moderate analysis time
  - Captures nearby regulatory elements
  - Good balance of speed vs comprehensiveness
  - Use when: Standard analysis with time constraints

• 100KB (100,000 bases) [DEFAULT]:
  - Comprehensive analysis
  - Captures distant regulatory elements
  - Most complete predictions
  - Use when: Thorough research analysis

• 500KB (500,000 bases):
  - Very comprehensive analysis
  - Slowest but most complete
  - Captures long-range regulatory effects
  - Use when: Critical variants needing maximum detail

• 1MB (1,000,000 bases):
  - Maximum context analysis
  - Longest analysis time
  - Research-grade comprehensiveness
  - Use when: Publication-quality analysis needed

RECOMMENDATION: Start with 100KB for most analyses. Use 2KB for quick tests
                or when the API is slow. Use 500KB+ for critical variants.'
